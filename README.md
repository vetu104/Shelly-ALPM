# Shelly: A Visual Arch Package Manager

![Shelly Wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shelly-Wiki-blue)

Shelly is a modern, visual package manager for Arch Linux, built with .NET 10 and Avalonia. It provides a user-friendly
interface for managing your Arch Linux system's packages by leveraging the power of `libalpm`.

## Features

- **Native Arch Integration**: Directly interacts with `libalpm` for accurate and fast package management.
- **Modern UI Framework**: Built using [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), ensuring a modern and responsive
  user interface.
- **Package Management**: Supports searching for, installing, updating, and removing packages.
- **Repository Management**: Synchronizes with official repositories to keep package lists up to date.

## Roadmap

Upcoming features and development targets:

- **Repository Modification**: Allow modification of supported repositories (First future release).
- **AUR Support**: Integration with the Arch User Repository for a wider range of software.
- **Package Grouping**: Group related packages for easier management.
- **Flatpak Support**: Manage Flatpak applications alongside native packages.
- **Snapd Support**: Support for Snap packages.

## Prerequisites

- **Arch Linux** (or an Arch-based distribution)
- **.NET 10.0 Runtime** (for running only if installed from aur)
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** (for building)
- **libalpm** (provided by `pacman`)

## Installation

### Using PKGBUILD

Since Shelly is designed for Arch Linux, you can build and install it using the provided `PKGBUILD`:
There is currently an issue with the package build and I suggest you run the local-install.sh after building it manually.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZoeyErinBauer/Shelly-ALPM.git
cd Shelly-ALPM
makepkg -si
```

### Manual Build

You can also build the project manually using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet publish Shelly-UI/Shelly-UI.csproj -c Release -o publish/shelly-ui
```

The binary will be located in the `/publish/shelly-ui/` directory.

## Usage

Run the application from your terminal or application launcher:

```bash
shelly-ui
```

*Note: Shelly will relaunch itself as root using pkexec if not already running as root.*

## Shelly-CLI

Shelly also includes a command-line interface (`shelly-cli`) for users who prefer terminal-based package management. The
CLI provides the same core functionality as the UI but in a scriptable, terminal-friendly format.

### CLI Commands

| `list-available`     | List all available packages     |
| `list-updates`       | List packages that need updates |
| `install <packages>` | Install one or more packages    |

## Development

Shelly is structured into several components:

- **Shelly-UI**: The main Avalonia-based desktop application.
- **Shelly-CLI**: Command-line interface for terminal-based package management.
- **PackageManager**: The core logic library providing bindings and abstractions for `libalpm`.
- **PackageManager.Tests**: Comprehensive tests for the package management logic.
- **Shelly-UI.Tests**: Unit tests for the Avalonia UI components.

### Building for Development
