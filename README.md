### About
Shelly is a modern reimagination of the Arch Linux package manager, designed to be a more intuitive and user-friendly
alternative to `pacman` and `octopi`. Unlike other Arch package managers, Shelly offers a modern, visual interface with a focus on
user experience and ease of use; It **IS NOT** built as a `pacman` wrapper or front-end. It is a complete reimagination of how a user
interacts with their Arch Linux system, providing a more streamlined and intuitive experience.

## Quick Install

Install Shelly with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoeyErinBauer/Shelly-ALPM/master/web-install.sh | sudo bash
```

This will download and install the latest release, including the UI and CLI tools.

## Features
- **Modern-CLI**: Provides a command-line interface for advanced users and automation, with a focus on ease of use.
- **Native Arch Integration**: Directly interacts with `libalpm` for accurate and fast package management.
- **Modern UI Framework**: Built using [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), ensuring a modern and responsive
  user interface.
- **Package Management**: Supports searching for, installing, updating, and removing packages.
- **Repository Management**: Synchronizes with official repositories to keep package lists up to date.
- **AUR Support**: Integration with the Arch User Repository for a wider range of software.
- **Flatpak Support**: Manage Flatpak applications alongside native packages. (Currently only in cli)

## Roadmap

Upcoming features and development targets:

- **Repository Modification**: Allow modification of supported repositories (First future release).
- **Package Grouping**: Group related packages for easier management.
- **Flatpak Support**: Manage Flatpak applications alongside native packages.
- **Desktop Integration**: Enhance integration with the desktop environment for seamless experience. Targeting KDE Plasma and Gnome initially.
- **Shelly Sync**: Multi-system sync lists that keep packages together across computers

## Prerequisites

- **Arch Linux** (or an Arch-based distribution)
- **.NET 10.0 Runtime** (for running only if installed from non *-bin aur package)
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** (for building)
- **libalpm** (provided by `pacman`)

## Installation

### Using PKGBUILD

Since Shelly is designed for Arch Linux, you can build and install it using the provided `PKGBUILD`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZoeyErinBauer/Shelly-ALPM.git
cd Shelly-ALPM
makepkg -si
```

### Manual Build

You can also build the project manually using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet publish Shelly-UI/Shelly-UI.csproj -c Release -o publish/shelly-ui
dotnet publish Shelly-CLI/Shelly-CLI.csproj -C Release -o publish/shelly-cli
```
alternatively you can run
```bash
sudo ./local-install.sh
```
This will build and perform the functions of install.sh

The binary will be located in the `/publish/shelly-ui/` directory.

## Usage

Run the application from your terminal or application launcher:

```bash
shelly-ui
```
In it's install location or by opening it from your applications menu.

## Shelly-CLI

Shelly also includes a command-line interface (`shelly-cli`) for users who prefer terminal-based package management. The
CLI provides the same core functionality as the UI but in a scriptable, terminal-friendly format.
